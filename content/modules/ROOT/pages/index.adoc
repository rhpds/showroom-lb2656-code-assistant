== Introduction

Thank you for taking the time to learn about implementing large language model technology to create your own code assistant! We're gonna have a good time, so get ready.

During this lab experience, you will:

. Setup a RHEL AI machine and deploy a Granite large language model
. Connect the running model on RHEL AI to a code assistant extension via API within Visual Studio Code on a separate RHEL machine
. Use the code extension to help you with some fun coding tasks
. **Bonus**: tinker around with a few additional small models using Ollama on the RHEL machine! 

By the end of the lab, you will know how to serve a large language model (LLM) on RHEL AI and implement that LLM technology practically in an active development environment. 

Sounds pretty useful - right? Let's go!

=== Environment Details

This lab is comprised of two primary system components: a RHEL AI instance (leveraging Image Mode RHEL technology) and a RHEL 9.4 machine with the Visual Studio Code (VSCode) application installed.

In your user interface, you have two tabs that will be used to the right of these instructions. The first tab, titled **Terminals** is for our two terminal windows. We will use these terminal windows to access both the RHEL AI server and the RHEL server with VSCode installed.

The second tab, titled **Terminals**, shows the VSCode application where you will use the code assistant extension that leverages the deployed Granite model.

Our first step is to setup our RHEL AI machine and deploy the Granite model.
